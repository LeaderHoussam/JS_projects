# Embarking on my JavaScript Journey

I've started exploring the world of JavaScript with two projects:

- Azertype: A project from OpenClassrooms to solidify my foundational JS knowledge (ongoing).
- ToDo App: A project to gauge my progress in JS development (ongoing).

Both projects are works in progress, but I'm excited to see how far I'll go!

# Commands
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/LeaderHoussam/JS_projects/

- Install dependencies (for ToDo App): npm install react-hook-form

- Start the development server: npm start
